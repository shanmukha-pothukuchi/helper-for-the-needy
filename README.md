## Inspiration
This is a problem in Howard county that needs to be solved.

## What it does
We decided to make a device that has the ability to find the Geo Location of that person, and also has a button, as well as a mic. When a person needs help for anything, they will click on the start rec button and say whatever they need! Then their message will be sent to an admin which the admin can accept or decline(only if they are playing around). Their location will be tracked and help will be sent to them by drones since it's coronavirus!

## How I built it
We used node.js, socket.io, HTML, CSS, and js. 

## Challenges I ran into
We had some difficulty doing speech recognition and geolocation.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
In the end with perseverance, we managed to make the speech recognition work and the geolocation thing work.

## What I learned
I learned that with perseverance I can get through any problem when it comes to coding.

## What's next for Helpers for the needy.
We want to make this more advanced and make it a product that every needy people can use.
